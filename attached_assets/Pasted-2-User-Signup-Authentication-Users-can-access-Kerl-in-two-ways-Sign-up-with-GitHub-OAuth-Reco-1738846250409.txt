2. User Signup & Authentication

Users can access Kerl in two ways:

Sign up with GitHub OAuth (Recommended) - Allows full integration with GitHub repositories.

Guest Mode - Users can upload OpenAPI files manually for documentation.

Upon signup, users are redirected to their dashboard where they can manage repositories, API documentation, and settings.

Core Features & Platform Workflow

1. AI Code Review Bot

The Kerl Code Review Bot automatically reviews pull requests (PRs) and provides AI-powered feedback.

How It Works:

User connects GitHub repo

OAuth Authentication allows Kerl to access selected repositories.

Alternatively, users can install the Kerl GitHub App to enable webhooks.

Bot detects new pull requests

Whenever a PR is opened or updated, Kerl fetches the code.

Code Analysis & Review

Runs linting tools (ESLint, Pylint, etc.).

Uses AI to detect bad practices and suggest improvements.

Security checks using tools like Snyk.

Automated PR Comments

Kerl posts inline comments with explanations and fixes.

Developers can accept or reject suggestions.

Dashboard Insights

Users can view detailed reports of code quality & history.

Tech Stack:

GitHub API & Webhooks for event detection

Node.js & Express for backend processing

OpenAI API for AI-driven code analysis

ESLint, Pylint, Snyk for linting & security

2. Interactive API Documentation Generator

Kerl helps developers create beautiful, interactive API documentation from OpenAPI (Swagger) specs.

How It Works:

User uploads OpenAPI file (.json or .yaml)

Or syncs it from a GitHub repo (auto-updates when API changes).

Kerl parses API schema

Extracts endpoints, parameters, and responses.

AI-Powered Enhancements

Suggests better descriptions, naming conventions, and best practices.

Detects missing security measures.

Interactive API Playground

Users can send test requests to endpoints (like Postman).

View real-time responses, headers, and error handling.

Deploy & Share Docs

Hosted documentation available at kerl.dev/docs/{project}.

Auto-updates from GitHub.
